### My Portfolio website
Welcome to my website!

You can access it at [victorl000.github.io/](https://victorl000.github.io/)

This SPA was all made using Three.js and GSAP on top of vanilla Javascript.

I realize it's not the most informative personal website out there, so think of it more as a design portfolio.

Todo:
- Really want a loading screen for that extra extra polish.
- The typography still seems _off_ for some reason...
